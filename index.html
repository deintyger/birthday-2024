          Happy Birthday, Dein! I’ve been waiting for this moment—to finally
          wish myself a happy birthday! Some might call it a funny obsession
          with my birthday, but it’s really just pure appreciation. 
          <p class="hero-card-p">I’m
          grateful for how far I've come, for being here to witness God’s love,
          and for the chance to keep fulfilling His purpose in my life.</p>
          <p class="hero-card-p">That’s what truly makes me happy. I’m proud of the woman I’m
          becoming every day. You know, most people might say, “If you’d told me
          a year ago I’d be doing this, I wouldn’t have believed it.” Well, I’m
          not most people—I always knew, haha!</p>
          <p class="hero-card-p">
          From a place of true vulnerability, I can say, “God has made perfect
          everything that concerns me.” I’m so grateful for my friends and
          mentors who keep me grounded and guide me, even though I can sometimes
          be a handful. Today, I just want to thank God for everything—He’s
          truly my secret potion.</p> 
          <p class="hero-card-p"> I can’t wait to see what 17 has in
          store! Maybe I'll even meet Fisayo Fosudo or Elon Musk—who knows? 😉</p>

                Just keep being yourself and never let your light stop shining. People might say you're loud, I say the same too, but that’s what makes you Shalom. That’s what makes you unique. You’ll always be surrounded by people of value and character. Just stay true to yourself in all that you do. Life will throw rocks at you, but remember that you have a God who’s always ready to cover you. You are beautiful, and don’t let anyone else define that beauty. Only you and God know it fully. I love you.</p><p class="body-card-p">- Deborah Enike</p></div>
